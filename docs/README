1. Connect to 10.55.70.28 using telnet. Login and password are unknown. 
Instead of telnet one can use "NPort Administrator" tool from Windows. 
It has even wider functionality but still requires a login/passwords unknown pair.

2. Configure NPort 5150A to work in a Real COM Mode. 
For further details see corresponding file in docs folder. 

3. Install new linux driver from the "drivers" folder.

4. For port forwarding and tty configuration see README file inside driver directory 

5. Investigate "protocol" folder which contains protocol documentation in README.TXT file and code example in EXAMPLE.C

6. Write the required tool - it should be easy!
